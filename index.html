            <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>

     <p>About eight years ago I started programming in Android using Java. I was immediately captivated by the fact that I could create my own original products, while at the same time learning skills that were valuable in the job market. </p>
        
       <p> I started developing a fantasy sports company, which turned into a multi-year passion project. And needless to say, during that time I learned a lot. </p> 
       <p>Most importantly, I learned self reliance as a developer and gained a  ‘never say die’ attitude when it comes to fixing problems. </p>
       <p>I eventually switched from native Android to native IOS, and completed that project in Swift. </p> 
       <p>More recently, I worked as a full stack web developer for <a href="https://www.dabblewriter.com" target="blank">Dabble</a>. And now I'm looking for a new opportunity where I can continue to stay remote, and work with a good group of people.</p>
       <p>Everything you see below is designed, wire-framed, and developed by yours truly.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>With traditional daily fantasy sports, the goal is to build a fantasy team of players on a single game basis, while keeping your budget under a given ‘salary cap’.</p>
                <p>With Darkhorse, you’re also given a salary cap, but instead of drafting a full team, you draft a single player, then use what’s left of your salary cap to buy additional game stats. </p>
                <p>If you draft an inexpensive ‘dark horse’ player, you’ll keep more of your remaining salary cap for stat buying.</p>
                <p>This gives lesser players a better chance at victory.</p>
                <p>Spend wisely and you'll help your player hit key achievements that boost his score above the competition.

                <p>
           
           Instead of swiping endlessly (like with Tinder and many similar apps), with Quik you pin locations you're already interested in going to and then start to look for potential matches from there. </p>
            <p>To add to the mystery (and also provide a layer of security), you won't know the exact location you matched with anyone until you mutually agree to reveal it. </p>
