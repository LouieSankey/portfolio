        <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My journey into programming began in 2014, sparked by a realization
          that my philosophy degree from the University of California, Davis had
          equipped me with a robust foundation in logic and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was instantly drawn to the thrill of building original products,
          while acquiring in-demand skills that were highly valued in the job
          market.
        </p>
        <p>
          This passion led me to developing a fantasy sports platform, which
          became a multi-year project. Although the venture didn't achieve
          commercial success, it was an invaluable learning experience. I honed
          my self-reliance as a developer and adopted a 'never say die' attitude
          toward problem-solving.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          I developed the first two version of that project on Android, but
          eventually switched to IOS and developed the final version in Swift.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          More recently, I worked as a full stack web developer for
          <a href="https://www.dabblewriter.com" target="blank">Dabble</a>,
          where I expanded my skill set and thrived in a collaborative team
          environment. I also released a full-stack SaaS productivity app for
          both web and mobile using the MERN stack and React Native.
        </p>

          <!-- <p>Live for 2022-2023 NBA season!</p> -->
          <h4>Technologies:</h4>
          <p class="tech-stack"><b>Client: </b>Swift 5</p>

          <p><b>Backend:</b> Node.js with Serverless Architecture</p>
          <br />
          <img
            src="./img/darkhorsescreenshots.png"
            class="portfolio-image"

          />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>Concept:</h4>
          <p>
            With traditional daily fantasy sports, the goal is to build a
            fantasy team of players on a single game basis, while keeping your
            budget under a given ‘salary cap’.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Darkhorse, you’re also given a salary cap, but instead of
            drafting a full team, you draft a single player, then use what’s
            left of your salary cap to buy additional game stats.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you draft an inexpensive ‘dark horse’ player, you’ll keep more of
            your remaining salary cap for stat buying.
          </p>
          <p>This gives lesser players a better chance at victory.</p>
          <p>
            Spend wisely and you'll help your player hit key achievements that
            boost his score above the competition.
          </p>

          Quik is destination based dating for people looking to explore their
          city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of swiping endlessly (like with Tinder and many similar apps),
          with Quik you pin locations you're already interested in going to and
          then start to look for potential matches from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add to the mystery (and also provide a layer of security), you
          won't know the exact location you matched with anyone until you
          mutually agree to reveal it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's designed for a simple, fun, and serendipitous user experience.

        <p>
          Similar to a word jumble game, Lightning Algo randomizes the lines of
          an algorithm and let's you drag them back into the correct order. With
          Lightning Algo, the name of the game is speed. Create custom lists of
          algorithms, then work on cycling through and descrambling them quickly
          to beat your previous best times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lightning Algo gives you a way to quickly and actively review any
          algorithms that you need to know for work or an upcoming interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is currently a prototype in 'demo' mode and a few features are
          disabled, but if you're an employer you can still check out some of
          the algorithms I've been reviewing ;-)
