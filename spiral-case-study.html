    <h2>Big Picture</h2>
    <p>By 2025, an estimated 70% of the workforce will be working remotely at least five days a month, and full time work from home employment is expected to double in 2021. At the same time, stress levels are at an all time high, and the mindfulness industry
        is expected to continue growing through 2027.</p>
    <h2>Why Me</h2>

    <p>This project was a perfect fit for my skill set as someone with a background in mindfulness techniques, as well as solid coding skills and an eye for minimal UX. I had previously tried several time tracking solutions, and found that they added little
        in the way of helping the user become more focused and productive.

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        If a productivity tool isn't well designed it can end up slowing you down, and doing the opposite of what's intended. With Spiral being an app that users need to return to frequently, it was imperative to keep a one click interface. It was also imperative
        to make switching the task you're tracking as seamless as possible. Additionally, putting yourself in a time crunch can induce stress, so it was also important that Spiral feel similar to a meditation app.

    <h2>Process & Solutions</h2>

    <p>By developing an early version as soon as possible I could start getting feedback. I then developed a second version with some notes to the user, so I could get improved feedback, and start working out the finer points of the UX. To make sure Spiral
        felt like a meditation app, I studied other apps in the mindfulness space, and looked for common design trends.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        With lessons learned, I was able to implement a third design that captured all of the requirements. The result is a time tracking experience that helps users reduce stress, while improving their time management skills and productivity. Additionally, by
        providing insight tracking, users can gain a clear picture of how much time they spent on a task,
